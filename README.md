# acoustic-network
Uses a ONE, ZERO and SYNC tone to encode data to be send between devices using
the microphone and speakers. Still a work in progress.

Can currently take a byte array, convert to frames, and the bits into the
tones. Can listen and recognize the tones.

Is not able to reconstruct the tones back into a data byte array yet.
